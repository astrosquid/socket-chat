Just a simple chat app in Socket.IO. Want this to evolve and become more as I continue to add functionality.

Currently, it has no login system and no access to a database. But if you connect to it, your chat partners are auto-assigned a random shade of blue for their chat bubbles, and given hashes to represent their identity. Very simple chatroom. I think I could play on the "no name" chat idea.
